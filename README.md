## Description

In 1984, Apple released the original Macintosh. As part of the system software, they shipped a collection of applications called Desk Accessories.

One such Desk Accessory was a simple calculator. This calculator stuck around more-or-less unchanged until Apple made the transition to Mac OS X.

Classic Calculator is a tribute to this long-lived tool, made to run on the latest iteration of macOS.

## Usage

Available for MacOS as a universal app for both Intel and Apple Silicon.
_Requires macOS 13 Ventura or later._
